title: Node Matching
---

We sometimes want to match nodes in one graph with nodes in another graph.  For 
named individuals and literals the matching process is straight forward.

By definition, two named individuals are *equal* if and only if they have the same 
IRI.  Two literals are *equal* if and only if they have the same lexical form, the
same datatype, and the same language tags (if any).
